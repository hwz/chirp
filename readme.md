A work in progress -- Teaching example for the MEAN stack by building out a Twitter clone named Chirp!

###Building Chirp, a MEAN Twitter Clone###

We're going to use the whole MEAN stack -- Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node -- to build out a simple but robust Twitter clone called Chirp. 

We're going to show you how to:
Create a dynamic front end by using the Angular.js front end framework
Run an server-side application with authentication services on Node.js
Model and store data in MongoDB
Build an API using Express

and deploy it all on Azure!
